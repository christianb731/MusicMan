Following this, copy the token generated from your bot's account and paste it into token.txt, replacing the instructional line.
Before running the bot, run setup.bat to install the dependencies necessary.
Then, run the run-bot.bat file to run the music bot.
If it is necessary for these dependencies to be updated, update-dependencies.bat will do so.

Usage:
Use the !command command to display all available commands.
To play a song, use the !play command followed by a song you would like to play to search youtube and play the song. Alternatively,
you can paste a link to directly play a song from a link. This works with other websites such as SoundCloud and Bandcamp.

Ex: !play float on modest mouse
